Now that we've looked at the architecture of the internet, let's see how you might

1
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.535
connect your personal devices to the internet inside your house.

2
00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:11.270
Well there are many ways to connect to the internet, and

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.960
most often people connect wirelessly.

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.940
Let's look at an example of how you can connect to the internet.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.370
If you live in a city or a town, you probably have a coaxial cable for

a dish outside you house, connecting you wirelessly to you closest ISP, or

10
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.190
you might also use the telephone system.

11
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.300 
Whether a wire comes straight from the ISP hookup outside your house, or

12
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.270
it travels over radiowaves from your roof,

13
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.760
the first stop a wire will make once inside your house, is at your modem.

14
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.780
A modem is what connects the internet to your network at home.

15
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.150
A few common residential modems are DSL or
